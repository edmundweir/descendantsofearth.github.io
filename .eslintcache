This action also earned me 500 life points (experience points), which leveled me up to level three and caused a tree to sprout in the future, increasing oxygen levels for my descendants.

It was abandoned by its creators towards the end of the 21st Century, and bears the markings of two different corporations. It’s constructors appear to have been experimenting in time-dilation technology before they mysteriously vanished. The early chapters of the game will be set in these barren regions. However, as the narrative expands, the Pipeline will be extended into southern latitudes towards the equator, where new areas, old cities and different factions lie in wait for the players to explore.\r\n                    </p> <br />\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    The team of engineers known as The Pipers have established their headquarters in an abandoned climate research station on the remote island of Jan Mayen, off the coast of Greenland. Here, they have constructed a Time Pump that looks somewhat like a windmill and detects temporal shifts that occur through changes to the timeline by player action. At the heart of the machine lies a time crystal that is turned by the arms of the windmill, and which detects changes to the reality. When a shift occurs, the materials produced in their dimension are identified by the Time Pump and rerouted into the Pipeline to be sent off to the descendants linked to the ancestor (the player) that took action. The team of engineers is made up of multiple departments, including Temporal Observation, Engineering, Climatology, Biology and IT, all of whom have particular needs and associated questlines.\r\n                    </p> <br />\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Life on Earth has changed dramatically, with rising temperature, sea levels, drought and fire driving most of the remaining human population towards the poles where the climate has become strangely tropical. The society that has emerged from these challenges is one without borders or a single clearly defined authority. Instead, it is made up of a multitude of groups and factions that the Pipers aim to connect through the Pipeline.\r\n                    </p> <br />\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    The descendants have heard stories of their ancestors' folly, but have only now come face to face with the people that reshaped the Earth. They expected to meet ignorant barbarians in 2020, and have been surprised to encounter people much like themselves. Now they are curious to know what life was like before it collapsed, and are eager for us to understand the urgency of our environmental problems.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Textbox>\r\n                <Textbox>\r\n                    <h2>Financing The Operation</h2>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Once the full game is released it will be free to download.\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        However, to make sure we can run our servers and continue to improve the game world, we are relying on the following revenue streams:\r\n                        <br /><br />\r\n                        <strong>Green business map & product list:</strong> By linking players to green product suppliers through our in-game action lists we earn an income from advertising.
